# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

The Kickstarter data set shows a set of campaigns in categories like film and video, theater, etc. and subcategories like television, plays, etc. which raise money in different counbtries. Each campaign and a goal and a pledged amount. The outcome ofthe campaign says if the goal amount is met or not.

Through the data set, we can determine whether or not the campaign succeeded (or canceld or live or failed), which category and subcategory the campaign belongs to and what impact factors like launch date, end date, country have on money raised in this campaign

Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. In this project, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals which is what we analyse in deliverables 1 and 2.
